Personal Site for Sorrel Brigman


I started with the artistic concept of this page while I was very new to coding. When I revisted the site several months later to see if I could flesh it out, I still very much enjoyed the artistic concept of the site, I just needed to fill out the content.

My original site was an experiment in CSS layering and rgba values.

As I began version two, I was more concerned with the responsiveness of the site, so I reduced my layered center image into a single image that I manipulated in Affinity Designer.

I then added an Angular view to the site, and presented my content through multiple angular partials.

My site is very simplistic, focusing on presenting content rather than offering a more distracting user experience.
